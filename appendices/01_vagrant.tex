\section{Overview}
HashiCorp, the company that owns Vagrant, describes it as \enquote{a tool for
building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow}. It
cooperates with traditional virtualization and configuration management
software in order to complete this taks. For example, a particular Vagrant
user may be using VirtualBox as their virtualization software and Chef as
their configuration software. They can then pass the Vagrantfile for a
project off to their coworker, who uses VMware and Puppet. Vagrant will use
these tools to set up the exact same development environment as the first
user got. If this file is then deployed on AWS, it will will create the same
environment again, ensuring that everyone gets the same results every time,
regardless of the underlying software used.
